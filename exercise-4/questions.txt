1. This is usually done by default to preserve data usage on mobile devices, as it
avoids loading large videos until the user has actually indicated that they want to
watch them by interacting with them (i.e., by pressing play).

2. Nothing at all, our device width falls outside that media query. It only applies
to devices where the device width/horizontal screen resolution is between 768px to 1024px.

3. Having two sites brings a whole lot of headaches, such as figuring out when to redirect a device from
one website to another, plus having to deal (or not deal) with users sharing links from a mobile
device to a desktop device and vice versa. It is often simpler to just bake responsiveness
into the main site rather than having two versions of the same content to maintain.

With a single (well-implemented) responsive website all your content ideally "just works" on any
device that opens it. It also often makes search engines happier, as they see you have a site that
works on both mobile and desktop user agents - Google and others often penalize sites that
do not work well on mobile. It usually leads to easier maintenance and an improved user experience
with less work than the two-page solution.
